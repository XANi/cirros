0.3.2
 - Recognize failure when getting entries from ec2 metadata service,
   especially annoying on 'ec2metadata --public-keys' (LP: #1148165)
 - fix bug on ec2 metadata service if no public keys available.
   Problem was that 404 was not being recognized (LP: #1148165)

   additional and irrelevant noise on console.

 - support 'seed' data from /var/lib/cloud/seed for nocloud and
   configdrive sources.
 - fix random and urandom device entries to be character rather
   than block devices.
 - if running in lxc (not libvirt-lxc), start getty on /dev/console
 - add usr/share/udhcpc/default.script which helps better control
   what happens on dhcp ifup.
 - support executing /etc/rc.local
 - set hostname from datasource (LP: #1132686)
 - fix bad entry for 'ftp' user in /etc/group (LP: #1222951)
