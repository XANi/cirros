- consider moving to yocto or micro-core linux
  - micro-core:
    - eglibc based, yet tiny size
    - packages made by others easily downloaded and used
    - no arm arch, and no public build system, so how would you build arm?
  - yocto:
    - eglibc based
    - could potentially use ubuntu debs or easily re-use binary packages
- some sort of "build-release"
  - that would do all the release build cleanly
  - download files, build, create release output
  - get-deps with config
    - get-deps conf/foo.conf (default 'dev')
      get-deps conf/0.3.conf
    - downloads kernels and buildroot and checksums
- automated testing on kvm and lxc
- configdrive support (openstack) and support for reading data from ISO
- add script for 'get-extra-modules'
  that would download modules from launchpad
