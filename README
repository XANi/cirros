This is a project to build a small cloud image that has useful tools and
function for debugging or developing cloud infrastructure.

To use it, you would do something like:

 * download buildroot and setup environment
   $ wget http://FIXME/buildroot-version.tar.gz
   $ tar -xvf buildroot-version.tar.gz
   $ ln -snf buildroot-version buildroot/
   $ mkdir output download

 * Build buildroot for a given arch
   $ make ARCH=i386 OUT_D=$PWD/output/i386

   This will do a full buildroot build, which will take a while. The output
   That mini-cloudimg is interested in is output/i386/rootfs.tar.
   That file is the full buildroot filesystem, and is used as input for
   subsequent steps here.

 * Download a kernel to use.
   mini-cloudimg expects the kernel in deb format.  It is built using the '-virtual'
   ubuntu kernels as a starting point.

   $ ARCH=i386
   $ url=http://FIXME/linux-image-2.6.38-8-virtual_2.6.38-8.42_$ARCH.deb
   $ wget "$url" -O "download/${url##*/}"
   $ kernel_deb="download/${url##*/}"

 * build disk images using bin/bundle
   $ sudo ./bin/bundle -v output/$ARCH/rootfs.tar "$kernel_deb" output/$ARCH/images

 * Then, test using the images
   $ kvm -drive file=disk.img,if=virtio -nographic
   $ kvm -kernel kernel -initrd initrd -drive file=blank.img,if=virtio -nographic
