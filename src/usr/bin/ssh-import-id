# busybox's wget does not support https
# as a result, I put a small web service up at 
# http://cirros.brickies.net/keys that simply gets
# the launchpad key and returns it.  Ie:
#   http://cirros.brickies.net/keys/v1/smoser 
# is the same as
#   https://launchpad.net/~smoser/+sshkeys

burl="http://cirros.brickies.net/keys/v1"

Usage() {
   cat <<EOF
Usage: ${0##*/} user1 [ user2 [ ... ] ]
   Import ssh keys for the user from http://launchpad.net

   **** NOTE *****
   This currently uses a service at ${burl}
   rather than using https://launchpad.net . That is because
   wget in busybox does not support https.  Be aware that that means
   a.) $burl could do evil things
   b.) someone could MIM you (as it is not http)
