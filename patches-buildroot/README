This directory contains patches to be applied to buildroot.
They're in quilt style format, but nothing automated will apply
them.  After downloading and extracting buildroot, linking it
to ./buildroot , you will need to run:
  ( cd buildroot && QUILT_PATCHES=$PWD/../patches-buildroot quilt push -a )
